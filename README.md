## xscast

**xscast** is a tool for creating mini-screencasts of a terminal or other

as you press them, and it outputs an animated GIF.

Dependencies: `ffmpeg convert xwininfo xinput dzen2`.

[Available on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xscast-git/) as
`xscast-git`.

Usage: `./xscast.sh out.gif` (for more information, see `xscast -h` or
`man xscast`)
